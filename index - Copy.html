				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> Hi y'all name is Abraham I'm a third year college student at UCSD. I am an Applied Mathematics student who is currently getting a minor in Math Education and Philosophy. I plan on going into the Masters and Teacher credential program that they have here at UCSD after I get my degree. The philosophy minor is simply because I enjoy philosophy and the kinds of questions they pose to our base understanding of our choices and ideals. </p>
